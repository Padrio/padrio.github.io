        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages according to § 7 Abs. 1 TMG under general law. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider, I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. Upon becoming aware of such violations, I will remove this content immediately.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-4">Liability for Links</h2>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          My offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of violations, I will remove such links immediately.
