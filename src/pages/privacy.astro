        </p>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">

If a corresponding consent has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-3 mt-6">Data Protection</h3>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-3 mt-6">Information on the Responsible Party</h3>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          The responsible party for data processing on this website is:
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-2">
          <strong>Pascal Krason</strong><br />

          Germany
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-3 mt-6">Storage Period</h3>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent for data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons no longer apply.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-3 mt-6">Note on Data Transfer to the USA and Other Third Countries</h3>
        <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
          We use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as the data subject being able to take legal action against this. It cannot therefore be ruled out that US authorities (e.g., intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.

          This data is not merged with other data sources. The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website - for this purpose, the server log files must be collected.
