# Project Context
You are an expert Senior Frontend Developer specializing in **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS**.

# Design Philosophy: "Warm Minimalist & Approachable"
The goal is a friendly, inviting, and highly readable design that appeals to both tech and non-tech audiences (e.g., showcasing community projects like Fire Department work). It should feel organic, clean, and warm, like a modern journal.

**STRICT RULE: NO DARK MODE. NO TECH/CYBERPUNK AESTHETICS.**

## 1. Color Palette (Light & Warm Theme)
- **Background Base:** `bg-stone-50` (A very soft, warm off-white, not sterile white).
- **Text Primary:** `text-stone-800` (Soft black/dark gray for main content).
- **Text Secondary:** `text-stone-500` (Warm gray for dates/subtitles).
- **Accent Color (Pastel Coral/Peach):**
    - Subtle backgrounds: `bg-orange-100` or `bg-rose-100`.
    - Text accents/links: `text-orange-600` or `text-rose-600`.
    - Buttons/Hover: A soft, warm gradient like `bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-300 to-rose-300`.

## 2. Surfaces & Depth (Paper Card Look)
- **Cards (Projects/CV):**
    - Instead of dark transparent glass, use opaque white surfaces: `bg-white`.
    - Use soft shadows for depth instead of glowing borders: `shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow`.
    - Borders should be extremely subtle or non-existent: `border border-stone-100`.
- **No Glassmorphism:** Do not use `backdrop-blur`.

## 3. Typography & Vibe
- **Font:** Keep it clean (Inter/Geist), but ensure weight isn't too heavy.
- **Headlines:** Use the dark gray text.
- **General Feel:** Use plenty of whitespace (padding/margin) to let content breathe. Avoid technical patterns like grids or dots in the background. Keep it clean.

## 4. Responsive Strategy
- **Mobile First:** Write CSS starting with mobile layout.
- **Touch Targets:** Ensure 44px+ size for touch inputs on mobile.
- **Typography Scaling:** Ensure headlines do not break awkwardly on small screens.

# Coding Rules
- Use `.astro` components.
- Ensure accessibility (high contrast between text and background).
- Keep it static and fast (GitHub Pages).
